## Project Description

To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) you will, in this project, explore the *market capitalization* of different cryptocurrencies. **Warning: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose.**
